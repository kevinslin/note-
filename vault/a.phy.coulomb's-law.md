# Coulomb's law
$$F = k \frac{q_1 \times q_2}{r^2}$$

$k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9$)
- identical to [[a.phy.newton's-law-of-universal-gravitation]]
- difference:
    - electric force can be +/-
    - gravitational force must be +
- shows that the electric force increases when charge increases and decreases when distance between them increases
- if more then two charges are present, **vector addition** must be done
