# Coulomb's law

$$F = k \\frac{q_1 \\times q_2}{r^2}$$

$k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \\times 10^9$)

- identical to [a.phy.newton's-law-of-universal-gravitation](e1286b96-53f0-461c-b0bd-5705a74e4ce6)
- difference:
  - electric force can be +/-
  - gravitational force must be +
- shows that the electric force increases when charge increases and decreases when distance between them increases
- if more then two charges are present, **vector addition** must be done
