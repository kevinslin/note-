# Newton's law of universal gravitation

$$F = G \\frac{m_1 \\times m_2}{r^2}$$

G is Gravitational constant ($6.67 \\times 10^{-11}$)
- difference:
  - electric force can be +/-
  - gravitational force must be +
- shows that the electric force increases when charge increases and decreases when distance between them increases
- if more then two charges are present, **vector addition** must be done
