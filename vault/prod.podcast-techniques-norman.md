## Podcast Techniques from [[Norman Chella | p.norman-chella]]

- **style of your own and use these as inspirations**
- I agree and disagree to some of their points in [[the video | r.vid.podcast-interview-techniques]], as my style is very different. 
- In my case, when it comes to deep diving into a guest (combination of googling the guest, searching their social media, and searching their name on podchaser if they've guested before) I find what I call **hidden questions**
  - Hidden questions are when you hear or read about them and you ask the **questions that were never brought up**. Ie. If they've guested before, and told a great story or opinion, but the interviewer doesn't inquire further into that - you can ask that question potentially once you have them as a guest on your show. 
- Hidden questions come from a combination of research, spontaneity, and ability to listen and pick up words from the guest that resonate with them best
- The way that I hold interviews is that I **listen in on their story, pick up anchoring words (terms they use to describe something) and re-use those in response to their answers**. It tells the guest I'm listening, and it tells the guest where I'm about to focus on. This primes them for the hidden question I might bring up
- But, you can't have too many prepped hidden questions - having too big of an outline freezes you up because you'd strive for structure over conversation. So I limit the number of written down questions and bet on getting questions on the fly 
- Your written question end up becoming your safety net if you feel the conversation going downwards and yeah. Totally could write a whole thing about interviewing on a show :)
- On getting good questions in general though, there are two types of really good ones: 
    - Yes-and-whys 
    - Challengers 
- The first is an **affirmation of what their belief in, and you asking them why**. The gold is in the why, and you're priming them by confirming for belief. 
  - If for example, I say to you that you're a huge believer in visual explanations and illustrated notes (you may agree). Why are written notes not good enough? 
  - The why is where I can hear you thinking and going about explaining your beliefs. There is gold there
- Challengers are **when you go against their belief or opinion with INTENT TO UNDERSTAND**. That last bit is an important one, because this question is risky - **if we frame it wrong we might sound like we're attacking the guest**. 
- These are questions that poke the guest to see if they have thought about the other side of their motion, or if they have ever question their belief or tried to find evidence to support their stuff. That's great, it's more discourse. The further you can facilitate that the better. But yeah, plenty more question types :)
