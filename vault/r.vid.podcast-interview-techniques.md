# [Podcast Interview Techniques with Andy Wang and Pete A Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsa94aYIal0&feature=youtu.be)

## Different Styles of Interviewing
### Pete A Turner
- many shows (5 a week!)
- professional
- can't keep up?
  - quality?
  - don't choose the topics, tell the stories
  - daily shows in addition to my weekly primary episode as a **huge benefit and increase in engagement**
- prepare 
  - know exactly what to want to say
  - pull the conversation to let it be what should it be 
- ask the question 
  - for the audience to hear it
  - prepare to be the audience (don't know anything)
  - **pull the most interesting question out in the conversation**
  - find out the **unknown unknowns**
  - put questions in the conversation
    - heard something that want to explore
      - **go deeper**
      - Overshadowing? (guests' feeling)
        - not go too far, how?
          - Don't ask examples 
          - **Focus on the person**
- eliminate mistakes, improve yourself
  - let the audience determine that
  - don't worry about the impact of the show
  - Three things that you want to keep track on for the show:
    1. audience need
    2. show need
    3. guest need



### Andy 
- barely keep up on the weekly schedule
- drain some weeks
    -  too much research
    -  **have an idea of what do you want to cover in the conversation**
    -  95% of them get published, 5% of them got cleaned up (didn't really add anything)
    -  basic outline
    -  always evolving 
       -  learning by doing 
       -  background -> key themes 
       -  fixed open and end question
- extract teachable moments, entertain them
  - **what topic?**
    - *outline of the whole interview*
    - what do the audience want to hear?
    - but the host has curiousity too
- Don't miss the opportunity to ask interesting question
- hoping that the next episode is better than the last one 
  - don't know which one gonna do well
  - we keep seeking for the best guest (curate the best guest)
    - but we can't predict which episode do well
- did the research
  - how specific I want to get?
    - back up
    - but audience haven't done the research
      - step a back up
  - making these decisions
    - what do you want to represent to the audience?
    - 

### Eric Hunley
- hard to come up original questions if a famous guy
- can't find the angle
