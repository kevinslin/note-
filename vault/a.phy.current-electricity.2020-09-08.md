# D.C. Circuits

$1 \Omega  = 1V/A$
$1W = 1J/s$
### How to overload an appliance?
---

A lightbulb: $$5V, 0.3A ==> 1.5W$$

$\text{If \ use \ a}  \ 10V  \ battery: 0.6A$   ([[Ohm's Law | a.phy.current-electricity.ohm's-law]]) ==> 6W  
1.  **over used**, about 4x brighter, but easier to burn 
2. **BURN**

### Current in a Series Circuit

1. How much volt across $R_1$?
20 $\Omega$; 0.2A flow through it = 4W

2. How much volt across $R_2$?
30 $\Omega$; 0.2A flow through it = 6W

Conclusions: 
- $R_1$ and $R_2$ "share" that 10V
- $R_1 (20 \Omega) < R_2 (30 \Omega)$
- 电阻高的分到更多电压

Since $R_2$ is bigger than $R_2$,
- $V_1 < V_2$

And $V_1 + V_2 = V \ (provided \ by \ cell)$

Equivalent Resistance = Effective Resistance = Total Resistance 有效电阻/等价电阻
