# Circuit Analysis

![](/assets/images/2020-09-10-11-18-53.png)

1. Check the resistance for ratio 
   - example: 8Ω -> 8V per ampere [Ohm's Law ](2858d2b2-1600-4660-92a3-7e853371a84b)
2. How much voltage it gained from the battery (All? Partial?)
3. How much current flow through it has been caused by the voltage?

## Examples

![](/assets/images/2020-09-10-11-22-31.png)

```
- In series circuit, see all resistors as one, **Current in any place are the same**
- so 20Ω + 30Ω = 50Ω
- 50Ω means 50V will cause 1A of current
  - **Hence, 10V (given) will cause 1/5A = 0.2A current flowing**
```

- For $R_1$
  - $V = I_1 R_1 = 0.2 times 20 = 4V$
- For $R_2$
  - 30V/1A
  - ?V ($30 times \\frac{1}{5} = 6V$)
  - 0.2A
- V1 + V2 = 6V + 4V = 10V = V

## Effective Resistance ($R_ef)

```
- same with **Equivalent Resistance** 
- Irrelevant if it is connected to any source
- Seen by the battery
```

- Calculation 
  - **Voltage of the battery /  total Current flows out from battery** 
    - R = V/I  [Ohm's Law ](2858d2b2-1600-4660-92a3-7e853371a84b)

## Current in a Parallel Circuit

![](/assets/images/2020-09-10-11-31-13.png)

```
- R1
  - 3V/A = 3Ω
  - 12V (all voltage from battery) given, hence **4A** produced
- R2
  - 6V/A = 6Ω
  - 12 V 
  - ==> **2A**
- Total Resistance?
  - $V_{battery}$
  - How many amperes flowed?
    - 4A + 2A = 6A
    - 12V/6A = 2Ω ($R_eff$)
```

 ![](/assets/images/2020-09-10-11-35-01.png)

```
- Power of R1?
  - V * I = 12V * 4A = 48 W 
-  $P_{R_2}$
    - V * I = 12V * 2A = 24W
```

- Battery?
  - P = 12V \* 6A = 72W
- Energy spent in 30s?
  - R1  
    - 48W \* 30s = 1440J
  - R2
    - 24W \* 30s = 720J
  - Battery?
    - 72W \* 30s = 2160J
- **Effective Resistance won't change even the voltage of the battery changes**

## Faster Way?

Since We know I, I1 and I2,

```
- By Applying Ohm's law, $I = \frac{V}{R}$
- and **$\frac{1}{R_{eff}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$**
```
